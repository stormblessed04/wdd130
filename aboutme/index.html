    <p>
        My name is Kyle Nordick. I'm here at BYUI studying software engineering and hope to 
        someday work in software development. In my free time I enjoy playing the piano, reading, 
        and just about anything to do with computers.

        I currently work as a maintenance tech for a fast food restaurant. It's been a good job, 
        but I have wanted to get into software for years and I'm excited to finally be making 
        progress in that direction.

        I'm excited to learn more about web development in this course. As a prospective software
        developer, web development is a large part of the industry and I'm excited to learn more 
        about what it entails. I don't consider myself very good with graphics or design, so web
        development isn't something I've really considered as a future career, but maybe this course 
        will change my mind.
