            What is Ham Radio?
            Ham Radio, or Amateur Radio, is a hobby all about experimenting with radios and using them to communicate with others. 
            It makes use of a set of radio frequencies set aside by federal regulations specifically for these users. Using radio waves, 
            licensed amateur radio operators can communicate over short distances, long distances, across the world, and even to spacecraft 
            like satellites and the ISS! Those that wish to be a part of this community are required to become licensed by passing a proctored 
            test and adhere to various regulations. Check out further information about licensing requirements and the radio frequencies 
            available to operators below!

            What can I do with a Ham Radio?
            Common uses of Ham radios include meeting and talking with others, 
            testing new equipment, participating in contests, and emergency communication. 
            The only real restrictions are that the ham radio frequencies can't be used for 
            any kind of commercial purpose or transmitting music. Beyond that it's up to you!

        <h3>Licensing</h3>
        <p>
            Licensing Information:
            There are three different tiers of ham radio licenses. The first tier is the Technician license, second is the 
            General license, and the final is the Amateur Extra license. Each level of license requires passing a written 
            multiple-choice test, and the levels must be taken in order. By completing the requirements for a higher level 
            license there are expanded options for frequency ranges that can be used for communication. 

            Technician License
            The Technician license is the lowest tier license with the easiest test. The written test includes questions 
            about electronics and radio theory, operation of a ham radio, and federal regulations. It grants operating 
            privileges in most of the upper radio frequencies of the VHF and UHF bands, and limited privileges in a few 
            of the lower bands. 

            General License
            The General license is the middle tier license. Its written test includes questions regarding more advanced 
            concepts, regulations, and practices. Holding this tier of license allows much more open radio usage, especially 
            on many of the HF bands used for long distance communication around the world. 

            Amateur Extra License
            The Amateur Extra license is the highest tier license available. People who hold this license are expected 
            to be experts in the world of ham radio, so its written test is all about the most advanced concepts and 
            regulations. Achieving this level of license allows wide-open access to all of the frequency bands available.

        <h3>Frequency Band Privileges</h3>
        <p>
            UHF Band
            All levels of ham radio license have three different bands available in the UHF, or Ultra High Frequency range. 
            These bands include the 23 cm, 33cm, and 70cm bands. These bands are used for a wide variety of experimentation 
            and communication methods. 

            VHF Band
            All levels of ham radio licenses also have full access to the three bands available in the VHF, or Very High 
            Frequency range. These include the 1.25 meter, 2 meter, and 6 meter bands. These bands are all used for local 
            communication, especially the 2 meter band, which is the most used band among ham radio operators. It is a 
            popular choice especially for emergency communication. The 6 meter band is also of note as it starts to allow 
            longer distance communication than is possible with higher frequency bands. 

            HF Band
            The HF, or High Frequency range includes the remainder of the ham radio operating privileges. These permissions 
            include frequency ranges in the 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, 30, 40, 80, 160, 630, and 2200 meter bands. Each band has 
            its own differences and idiosyncrasies, but each is used for long-distance communication. Operating privileges 
            on these bands are restricted to those with General and Amateur Extra licenses, with Amateur Extra license 
            holders granted wider permissions than General license holders.
